# cTools
Simple to use implementations of well-known data structures & algorithms in C.


# TODO
- [ ] Add header guards
- [ ] Write DOCS
- [x] Implement hashmaps
    - [ ] Write better test for unsortedHashmap
    - [ ] Implemented sortedHashmaps
- [ ] Write better Makefile
- [X] Implement Queues
    - [ ] Write better tests for regular queues
    - [ ] Implement priority queues
- [X] Implement LinkedLists
    - [ ] Write better tests for LinkedLists
    - [ ] Implement Doubly LinkedLists
- [ ] Give different names to Nodes so it doesn't come to conflict when using multiple different data structures


# Notes
Implemented unions in hashmaps to be able to store multiple types but it is now way harder for end-user to use hashmaps.
