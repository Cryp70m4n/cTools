    - [ ] Write better tests for regular queues
    - [ ] Implement priority queues
- [X] Implement LinkedLists
    - [ ] Write better tests for LinkedLists
    - [ ] Implement Doubly LinkedLists


# Notes
Implemented unions in hashmaps to be able to store multiple types but it is now way harder for end-user to use hashmaps.
